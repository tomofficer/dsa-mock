// INSTRUCTIONS :

/*
Write a function named searchLines() that accepts:

words: a linked list of words
concordance: a concordance of a body of text formatted as described above
data: the original body of text from which the concordance was generated
Generate an array of strings representing the lines of text in which any of the words in the list appears.

For example, given the following concordance:

{
    exile: [ 11 ],
    full: [ 12, 23, 25, 49, 55 ],
    equality: [ 12 ],
    fair: [ 12 ]
}
and the words "exile", "equality" and "fair" and text given in the src/data.js file, construct the resulting array as follows:

The word "exile" occurs on line 11 and both words "equality" and "fair" appear on line 12 so return the lines 11 and 12. The result will be:

[
  "No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.",
  "Everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of his rights and obligations and of any criminal charge against him."
]
*/

// DATA DEPENDENCIES BELOW :

/*
Note : for this example we will be using arrays, in the actual exam they will use linked lists which you must convert to arrays using a built in method they provide called asArray(); 

For brevity and reference the conversion code for that will be commented out within the function.
